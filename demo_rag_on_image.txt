Recent Developments in Indian Politics

LET US DO IT TOGETHER
This chapter covers the major developments in Indian politics until
the 2004 Elections (14th Lok Sabha). Subsequently, the Lok Sabha
elections were held in 2009, during which the UPA led by the Congress
won. In the 2014 and 2019 Elections, the NDA led by the BJP emerged
victorious. The position of various parties in the 17th Lok Sabha is given
on page 155.
A detailed study of Members of the 17th Lok Sabha is available on the
website of the Lok Sabha (http://loksabha.nic.in).
Compare and contrast the electoral performances of various political
parties since 2004. The table given below can be used for this. You can
also collect the data about the results from the website of the Election
Commission of India (http://eci.nic.in).

CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
INTEGRITY PLEDGE
I believe that corruption has been one of the major obstacles to
economic, political and social progress of our country. I believe that all
stakeholders such as Government, citizens and private sector need to
work together to eradicate corruption.
I realise that every citizen should be vigilant and commit to highest
standards of honesty and integrity at all times and support the fight
against corruption.
I, therefore, pledge:
To follow probity and rule of law in all walks of life;
To neither take nor offer bribe;
To perform all tasks in an honest and transparent manner;
To act in public interest;
To lead by example exhibiting integrity in personal behaviour;
To report any incident of corruption to the appropriate agency.
