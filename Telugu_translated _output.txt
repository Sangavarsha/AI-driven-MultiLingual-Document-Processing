Who lives in harmony with the knowledge gained by reading books or modern civilization
We can call people folk. If we look at the life of these peoples a little, to the essence of it,
It will be revealed that the arts, especially dance, and music have no particular priority. Songs, geese, stories
We all see scenes of them dancing on their tongues, such as enormous tenderness, etc.
Can be used. But these songs, which have been popular for a number of reasons over the years of this century,
The geese seem to be losing priority among the masses.

Not only in the essence of the folk, but also in their dance music, the uniqueness, the ornamentation
Just as the literature of those who do not adhere to the standards set by the sciences, the characterizations, their dance musics are niche
Transcending the laconic texts, the Bharathu wrote about the dance of these folk dances in his theatre.
As mentioned, later, decorators should not have noticed their existence. Folk remedies
Our indigenous traditions are reflected in their dance music just as reflected by the culture of Manadesh.
It can undoubtedly be said that these dances are like a mirror that conveys the tastes and tastes of the folk.
The words Sarangapani are a reference to folk music and dance music. Folklore

When the second duki started, Pachan had to pick up a song. Kannan followed and started the Pachan operation.
